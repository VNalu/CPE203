I moved all the methods that created/editted used an entity/used entity as the main object for an entity in entity.
I then moved variables used in those methods into the the same class.
With the remaining methods I looked at what those editted/created/mostly relied on and put those and their variables in the corresponding classes.
Also if a method contained key words that were also used in a class name, I put it there (within reason).
Lastly, for the quakes, a quake is an event so the creation of an event I put in event scheduler.
